What can Jubilee offer in these times of modern 3D printing?
------------------------------------------------------------

We think a lot actually!

Jubilee offers a tool-changing approach to multi-material 3D printing, one that offers fast material changes and
produces less waste than the filament-changing approach.
But Jubilee is more than just a printer.
We see Jubilee as an "API for programmable motion" for bespoke automation applications--including
multi-material printing--while staying in the same price range of a performant single-tool 3D printer.
Finally, as modern printers get harder to "hack," Jubilee stands to be the opposite.
With 3D printers becoming more performant but also more tightly integrated, Jubilee stands out as both open and readily
extendable with a plethora of design notes and examples to tailor the machine to your liking.

It is a tinkerer's platform that affords hacking.
