What's new in Jubilee 3?
------------------------

Jubilee 3 is a complete redesign from the ground-up, bringing a whirlwind of fixes and changes, including:

* a stiffer frame
* a sturdier carriage-to-tool interface
* $500USD *cheaper* than Jubilee-2
* `Klipper <https://www.klipper3d.org/>`_ compatibility
* new or updated tools

all while still being "self-sourceable" in single units by everyday folks without access to a fancy machine shop.
For the full breakdown, see the start of the project's `changelog <https://github.com/jubilee3d/jubilee-3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#reljubilee-300>`_.
