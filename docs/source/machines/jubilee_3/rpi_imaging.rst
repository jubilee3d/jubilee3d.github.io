Raspberry Pi OS Image Setup
===========================

Next we will flash the Operating System onto the Raspberry Pi, which will serve
as the high-level "brains" for Jubilee.

We'll be installing a *headless* setup without a desktop as `strongly recommended <https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html#installing-via-kiauh>`_ by *Klipper*, the firmware we'll be using to manage the machine's motors and sensors.
Don't worry, though. We will ultimately still be able to control the machine through a graphical user interface using a web browser, or through Python directly.


You will need
-------------

* a Micro-SD card
* an SD card-to-USB adapter (if you cannot)
* a PC or laptop
