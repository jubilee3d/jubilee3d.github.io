Manual Tool Alignment
=====================

All tools in use need to be aligned relative to each other.
That is, their X, Y, and Z offsets need to be known and stored in the firmware configuration such that location commands sent to each tool takes them to the same point in space, regardless of tool.
To do this, we need to dial in the X, Y, and Z offsets for each tool.
