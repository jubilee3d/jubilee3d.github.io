What's new in Jubilee 3?
------------------------

For the full breakdown, see the start of the project's changelog.

What can Jubilee offer in these times of modern 3D printing?
------------------------------------------------------------
We think a lot actually!

Jubilee offers a tool-changing approach to multi-material 3D printing, one that offers fast material changes and
produces less waste than the filament-changing approach.
But Jubilee is more than just a printer.
We see Jubilee as an "API for programmable motion" for bespoke automation applications--including
multi-material printing--while staying in the same price range of a performant single-tool 3D printer.
Finally, as modern printers get harder to "hack," Jubilee stands to be the opposite.
With 3D printers becoming more performant but also more tightly integrated, Jubilee stands out as both open and readily
extendable with a plethora of design notes and examples to tailor the machine to your liking.

It is a tinkerer's platform that affords hacking.

How are E3D and Jubilee tool plates different from each other?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The tool ball pattern and lock location are sized such that tool plates are interchangeable between machines, but
Jubilee tool plates make two key changes that make it perform differently.

First, Jubilee tool plates adopt a 6mm tool ball size (down from 8mm) as of Jubilee-3.
This change helps retain the tool *deeper* in the coupling at a more aggressive angle, enabling the machine to zip
around at faster speeds while keeping the tool locked in firmly.

Second, Jubilee tool plates use a *Delrin* helix feature (instead of hardened tool steel) to help the coupling
lock the tool.
*Delrin* is an exceptionally slippery and wear-resistant thermoplastic commonly used in gears.
This material change helps Jubilee tools lock into the coupling without snagging on the twist lock.
As the softer material, these wedge plates are a consumable and will need to be replaced, but they have been tested
beyond 10,000 tool changes without any apparent wear.
Finally, because Jubilee's locking mechanism is torque-based and not position-based, these plates can be used even
as they do begin to show signs of wear since the exact locking angle does not affect the tool's ability to lock.

For other changes, see the E3D and Jubilee spec sheet.

How did Jubilee come to be?
---------------------------

Jubilee was created by Sonya Vasquez. It is her "love letter to scientists, hackers, and engineers alike--or anyone
who's ever been tempted to duct tape something onto the business end of their 3D printer."
