With the existing family of tools, Jubilee can be used for

* multi-material 3D printing
* automated inspection
* lab automation


Jubilee is a reference design.
It can serve as a starting point for multi-tool applications or as and end-point in itself.


..
  Jubilee might be a familiy of machines one day!
