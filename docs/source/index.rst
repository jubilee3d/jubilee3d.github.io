Combined with an ecosystem of tools and bed plates, Jubilee can be tailored to a variety of applications, including:

* multi-material 3D printing
* automated inspection
* lab automation

Getting Started
---------------

There are *many* paths to using Jubilee.
We suggest starting by (1) picking a :doc:`workflow </workflows/workflows>` and (2) building the components you need to execute that workflow.

    What is Jubilee?
    ----------------

    Jubilee is an ecosystem of open source hardware designs for various applications.
    The idea is that you, the scientist, hacker, engineer, or student are interested in exploring some sort of programmable machine application, but you don't want to start from scratch.


    How to use this site
    --------------------
    This site is broken down into both distinct *hardware designs* for machines, tools, and bed plates and then *workflows* that ask you to build components from those sections to explore a custom programmable task.
    Each type of
