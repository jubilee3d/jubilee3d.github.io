Jubilee 2 is the original Jubilee developed in 2018-2022.
Further development on Jubilee has been paused since `release 2.2.1 <https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/releases/tag/v2.2.2>`_.
For going forward, we recommend starting with :doc:`Jubilee 3 </machines/jubilee_3/jubilee3>`.


Building Jubilee
================

To build the Jubilee, you will need to

1. Acquire parts from a :doc:`kit </kits>` or by ordering parts individually from the :doc:`Bill-of-Materials </machines/jubilee_2/bom>`.
2. Follow the :doc:`hardware assembly </machines/jubilee_2/hardware_assembly>` instruction booklets to build the frame.
3. Follow the remaining guides on the left sidebar to configure the Jubilee's software, firmware, and electronics.
