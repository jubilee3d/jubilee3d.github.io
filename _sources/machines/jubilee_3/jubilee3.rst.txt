Jubilee 3 is the latest rendition of Jubilee developed in 2023-24.
V3 collects years worth of notes from V2 and Discord to produce a machine that's
lighter, stiffer, and faster than the original--all while preserving what makes Jubilee "Jubilee."


Building Jubilee
================

1. Acquire parts from a :doc:`kit </kits>` or by ordering parts individually from the :doc:`Bill-of-Materials </machines/jubilee_3/bom>`.
2. Follow the :doc:`hardware assembly </machines/jubilee_3/hardware_assembly>` instruction booklets to build the frame.
