How can I support the project?
------------------------------

There are plenty of ways!

* Participate in Discord to keep the community active and healthy. Ask questions, help others, and showcase your stuff! It's invigorating to see what others have created.
* Share your designs and derivatives. Have a new tool design that does something totally niche? Let's feature it loud-and-proud on this website. It makes a world of difference to have other hackers and organizations legitimize the project by sharing their work.
* Buy a kit. A portion of kit sales go back to the original Jubilee designer.
* Sponsor this project. Share your support (via `Ko-fi <https://ko-fi.com/poofjunior>`_) to help grow the ecosystem.
* Commission a custom tool. If you're looking to get something designed but don't have the time or resources, reach out.
