What are the differences between E3D and Jubilee tool plates?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The tool ball pattern and lock location are sized such that tool plates are interchangeable between machines, but
Jubilee tool plates make two key changes that make it perform differently.

First, Jubilee tool plates adopt a 6mm tool ball size (down from 8mm) as of Jubilee-3.
This change helps retain the tool *deeper* in the coupling at a more aggressive angle, enabling the machine to zip
around at faster speeds while keeping the tool locked in firmly.

Second, Jubilee tool plates use a *Delrin* helix feature (instead of hardened tool steel) to help the coupling
lock the tool.
*Delrin* is an exceptionally slippery and wear-resistant thermoplastic commonly used in gears.
This material change helps Jubilee tools lock into the coupling without snagging on the twist lock.
As the softer material, these wedge plates are a consumable and will need to be replaced, but they have been tested
beyond 10,000 tool changes without any apparent wear.
Finally, because Jubilee's locking mechanism is torque-based and not position-based, these plates can be used even
as they do begin to show signs of wear since the exact locking angle does not affect the tool's ability to lock.
