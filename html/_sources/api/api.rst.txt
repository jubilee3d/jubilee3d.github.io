API
===

Jubilee natively supports a GCode serial interface, which works well for 3D printing.
For everything else, the Jubilee API provides an enhanced object-oriented interface written in Python that better supports Jubilee's niche tools.
This API can be used directly on the Jubilee's own Raspberry Pi running Klipper, or it can be run from a separate PC.


Installation
------------

From your PC (or Jubilee's Klipper RPi), run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install jubilee-api
